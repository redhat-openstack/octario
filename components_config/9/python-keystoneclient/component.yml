# This file is used by the octario testing framework to configure system
# for various tests like pep8, unit, functional or tempest.

# Dependencies are installed from repositories configured on the
# testing system.

# Dependecies should not have explicit versions if they are satisfied by RHOSP
# repository. If the version or dependency itself is not satisfied by the
# RHOSP repository it should contain specified version e.g. python-hacking-1.0
# If no version is specified in such case the highest one will get installed
# and it will be hard to control from where the dependencies are used.

# Comments should be put above tester definition, otherwise error will occur.

# Each shell command should end with ';' if multiple are specified.

# Any hard coded install commands that will use pip installation
# method from the tox.ini should be removed, see example /usr/bin/sed below.
# It is because pip installation method should not be used / mixed with rpm.
# In below example install_command and deps are commented out. Those two
# shell commands are duplicated across other testers except tempest, where
# is not needed. If all testers were requiring such commands then that part
# could be easilly moved to run from nova_virt_run_config section and less
# duplication would occur.

# The line with "hostvars[inventory_hostname][tester.component.tox_target]"
# simply calls the section ['rpm_deps'] for the particular tester within this
# configuration file. The tox_target is tester like pep8, unittest, functional
# tempest or any other and allows to use below rpm_deps that is common
# for all testers that calls rpm_deps for specific one.
