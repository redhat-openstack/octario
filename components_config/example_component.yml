# This file is used by the octario testing framework to configure system
# for various tests like pep8, unit, functional or tempest.

# Dependencies are installed from repositories configured on the
# testing system.

# Dependecies should not have explicit versions if they are satisfied by RHOSP
# repository. If they version or dependency itself is not satisfied by the
# RHOSP repository it should contain specified version.


# Comments should be above tester definition.

# Each shell command should end with ';' if multiple are specified.

# Any hard coded install commands that will use pip installation
# method from the tox.ini should be removed, see example /usr/bin/sed below.
# It is because pip installation method should not be used / mixed with rpm.
# In below example install_command and deps are commented out. Those two
# shell commands are duplicated across other testers except tempest, where
# is not needed. If all testers were requiring such commands then that part
# could be easilly moved to run from nova_virt_run_config section and less
# duplication would occur.

pep8:

# python-nova is installed to satisfy all runtime dependencies for the nova
# component. It is then removed, so all dependent packages are present but
# the test runs against codebase from gerrit and not the system one.

unittest:

# to satisfy all runtime dependencies for the nova component. Similarly to
# above unittest tester, however it pulls much more codebase from nova
# which is also present in the nova git repository.
