From the CI perspective we can fail the job if pip3 installed version is grater then the version that was installed from the RPM (or at least to issue a warning). What is your option on that?",

With that cinder project specified greenlet minimal version in requirements.txt. Octario is a part of CI harness. If the the minimal version can be lowered, the right place to do it is in requirements.txt. So we can land this change for octario and submit a downstream change for requirements.txt.\n\nAnd what is your take on heaving warnings if pip3 installed version is grater then the version that was installed from the RPM?",
