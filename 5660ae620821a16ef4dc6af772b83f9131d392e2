See cryptography which is bumped to 37.0.2 , boto3 to 1.23.10, which should be at most 3.4.6 and 1.17.26 respectively, and there are many others. They are installed when installing moto, I\u0027m sure there is a way to find the right combination.",

We need a solution anyway which will be reused in the new jobs.\n\nSo let\u0027s fix it for now. Again: we need to trim down the amount of additional packages installed from pip which overrides the RPM ones, and we need the fix now.",
